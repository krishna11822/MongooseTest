Even when you don't use the views object\n     *   explicitly on a state config, one is still created for you internally.\n     *   So by decorating this builder function you have access to decorating template\n     *   and controller properties.\n     * - **ownParams** `{object}` - returns an array of params that belong to the state,\n     *   not including any params defined by ancestor states.\n     * - **path** `{string}` - returns the full path from the root down to this state.\n     *   Needed for state activation.\n     * - **includes** `{object}` - returns an object that includes every state that\n     *   would pass a `$state.includes()` test.\n     *\n     * #### Example:\n     * Override the internal 'views' builder with a function that takes the state\n     * definition, and a reference to the internal function being overridden:\n     * ```js\n     * $stateProvider.decorator('views', function (state, parent) {\n     *   let result = {},\n     *       views = parent(state);\n     *\n     *   angular.forEach(views, function (config, name) {\n     *     let autoName = (state.name + '.' + name).replace('.', '/');\n     *     config.templateUrl = config.templateUrl || '/partials/' + autoName + '.html';\n     *     result[name] = config;\n     *   });\n     *   return result;\n     * });\n     *\n     * $stateProvider.state('home', {\n     *   views: {\n     *     'contact.list': { controller: 'ListController' },\n     *     'contact.item': { controller: 'ItemController' }\n     *   }\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * ```js\n     * // Auto-populates list and item views with /partials/home/contact/list.html,\n     * // and /partials/home/contact/item.html, respectively.\n     * $state.go('home');\n     * ```\n     *\n     * @param {string} name The name of the builder function to decorate.\n     * @param {object} func A function that is responsible for decorating the original\n     * builder function. The function receives two parameters:\n     *\n     *   - `{object}` - state - The state config object.\n     *   - `{object}` - super - The original builder function.\n     *\n     * @return {object} $stateProvider - $stateProvider instance\n     */\n    StateProvider.prototype.decorator = function (name, func) {\n        return this.stateRegistry.decorator(name, func) || this;\n    };\n    StateProvider.prototype.state = function (name, definition) {\n        if (isObject(name)) {\n            definition = name;\n        }\n        else {\n            definition.name = name;\n        }\n        this.stateRegistry.register(definition);\n        return this;\n    };\n    /**\n     * Registers an invalid state handler\n     *\n     * This is a passthrough to [[StateService.onInvalid]] for ng1.\n     */\n    StateProvider.prototype.onInvalid = function (callback) {\n        return this.stateService.onInvalid(callback);\n    };\n    return StateProvider;\n}());\nexport { StateProvider };\n//# sourceMappingURL=stateProvider.js.map","/** @publicapi @module ng1 */ /** */\nimport { services, ResolveContext, extend, } from '@uirouter/core';\nimport { getLocals } from '../services';\n/**\n * This is a [[StateBuilder.builder]] function for angular1 `onEnter`, `onExit`,\n * `onRetain` callback hooks on a [[Ng1StateDeclaration]].\n *\n * When the [[StateBuilder]] builds a [[StateObject]] object from a raw [[StateDeclaration]], this builder\n * ensures that those hooks are injectable for @uirouter/angularjs (ng1).\n *\n * @internalapi\n */\nexport var getStateHookBuilder = function (hookName) {\n    return function stateHookBuilder(stateObject, parentFn) {\n        var hook = stateObject[hookName];\n        var pathname = hookName === 'onExit' ?

the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * ### Linked State\n * The attribute value of the `ui-sref` is the name of the state to link to.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This will activate the `home` state when the link is clicked.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Relative Links\n * You can also use relative state paths within `ui-sref`, just like a relative path passed to `$state.go()` ([[StateService.go]]).\n * You just need to be aware that the path is relative to the state that *created* the link.\n * This allows a state to create a relative `ui-sref` which always targets the same destination.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Both these links are relative to the parent state, even when a child state is currently active.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\".child1\">child 1 state</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\".child2\">child 2 state</a>\n * ```\n *\n * This link activates the parent state.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"^\">Return</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### hrefs\n * If the linked state has a URL, the directive will automatically generate and\n * update the `href` attribute (using the [[StateService.href]]  method).\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Assuming the `users` state has a url of `/users/`\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"users\" href=\"/users/\">Users</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Parameter Values\n * In addition to the state name, a `ui-sref` can include parameter values which are applied when activating the state.\n * Param values can be provided in the `ui-sref` value after the state name, enclosed by parentheses.\n * The content inside the parentheses is an expression, evaluated to the parameter values.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This example renders a list of links to users.\n * The state's `userId` parameter value comes from each user's `user.id` property.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"user in users\">\n *   <a ui-sref=\"users.detail({ userId: user.id })\">{{ user.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * Note:\n * The parameter values expression is `$watch`ed for updates.\n *\n * ### Transition Options\n * You can specify [[TransitionOptions]] to pass to [[StateService.go]] by using the `ui-sref-opts` attribute.\n * Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`, and `reload`.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\" ui-sref-opts=\"{ reload: true }\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Other DOM Events\n *\n * You can also customize which DOM events to respond to (instead of `click`) by\n * providing an `events` array in the `ui-sref-opts` attribute.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <input type=\"text\" ui-sref=\"contacts\" ui-sref-opts=\"{ events: ['change', 'blur'] }\">\n * ```\n *\n * ### Highlighting the active link\n * This directive can be used in conjunction with [[uiSrefActive]] to highlight the active link.\n *\n * ### Examples\n * If you have the following template:\n *\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\"about\">About</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\"{page: 2}\">Next page</a>\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">{{ contact.name }}</a>\n *     </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Then (assuming the current state is `contacts`) the rendered html including hrefs would be:\n *\n * ```html\n * <a href=\"#/home\" ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * <a href=\"#/about\" ui-sref=\"about\">About</a>\n * <a href=\"#/contacts?page=2\" ui-sref=\"{page: 2}\">Next page</a>\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a href=\"#/contacts/1\" ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">Joe</a>\n *     </li>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a href=\"#/contacts/2\" ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">Alice</a>\n *     </li>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a href=\"#/contacts/3\" ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">Bob</a>\n *     </li>\n * </ul>\n *\n * <a href=\"#/home\" ui-sref=\"home\" ui-sref-opts=\"{reload: true}\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Notes\n *\n * - You can use `ui-sref` to change **only the parameter values** by omitting the state name and parentheses.\n * #### Example:\n * Sets the `lang` parameter to `en` and remains on the same state.\n *\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"{ lang: 'en' }\">English</a>\n * ```\n *\n * - A middle-click, right-click, or ctrl-click is handled (natively) by the browser to open the href in a new window, for example.\n *\n * - Unlike the parameter values expression, the state name is not `$watch`ed (for performance reasons).\n * If you need to dynamically update the state being linked to, use the fully dynamic [[uiState]] directive.\n */\nvar uiSrefDirective;\nuiSrefDirective = [\n

and [[uiState]] to add classes to an element when the\n * related directive's state is active (and remove them when it is inactive).\n *\n * The primary use-case is to highlight the active link in navigation menus,\n * distinguishing it from the inactive menu items.\n *\n * ### Linking to a `ui-sref` or `ui-state`\n * `ui-sref-active` can live on the same element as `ui-sref`/`ui-state`, or it can be on a parent element.\n * If a `ui-sref-active` is a parent to more than one `ui-sref`/`ui-state`, it will apply the CSS class when **any of the links are active**.\n *\n * ### Matching\n *\n * The `ui-sref-active` directive applies the CSS class when the `ui-sref`/`ui-state`'s target state **or any child state is active**.\n * This is a \"fuzzy match\" which uses [[StateService.includes]].\n *\n * The `ui-sref-active-eq` directive applies the CSS class when the `ui-sref`/`ui-state`'s target state is directly active (not when child states are active).\n * This is an \"exact match\" which uses [[StateService.is]].\n *\n * ### Parameter values\n * If the `ui-sref`/`ui-state` includes parameter values, the current parameter values must match the link's values for the link to be highlighted.\n * This allows a list of links to the same state with different parameters to be rendered, and the correct one highlighted.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"user in users\" ui-sref-active=\"active\">\n *   <a ui-sref=\"user.details({ userId: user.id })\">{{ user.lastName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Examples\n *\n * Given the following template:\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <ul>\n *   <li ui-sref-active=\"active\" class=\"item\">\n *     <a href ui-sref=\"app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})\">@bilbobaggins</a>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * When the app state is `app.user` (or any child state),\n * and contains the state parameter \"user\" with value \"bilbobaggins\",\n * the resulting HTML will appear as (note the 'active' class):\n *\n * ```html\n * <ul>\n *   <li ui-sref-active=\"active\" class=\"item active\">\n *     <a ui-sref=\"app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})\" href=\"/users/bilbobaggins\">@bilbobaggins</a>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Glob mode\n *\n * It is possible to pass `ui-sref-active` an expression that evaluates to an object.\n * The objects keys represent active class names and values represent the respective state names/globs.\n * `ui-sref-active` will match if the current active state **includes** any of\n * the specified state names/globs, even the abstract ones.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Given the following template, with \"admin\" being an abstract state:\n * ```html\n * <div ui-sref-active=\"{'active': 'admin.**'}\">\n *   <a ui-sref-active=\"active\" ui-sref=\"admin.roles\">Roles</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Arrays are also supported as values in the `ngClass`-like interface.\n * This allows multiple states to add `active` class.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Given the following template, with \"admin.roles\" being the current state, the class will be added too:\n * ```html\n * <div ui-sref-active=\"{'active':

applied to both the `<div>` and `<a>` elements.\n * It is important to note that the state names/globs passed to `ui-sref-active` override any state provided by a linked `ui-sref`.\n *\n * ###

Attributes\n *\n * - `name`: (Optional) A view name.\n *   The name should be unique amongst the other views in the same state.\n *   You can have views of the same name that live in different states.\n *   The ui-view can be targeted in a View using the name ([[Ng1StateDeclaration.views]]).\n *\n * - `autoscroll`: an expression. When it evaluates to true, the `ui-view` will be scrolled into view when it is activated.\n *   Uses [[$uiViewScroll]] to do the scrolling.\n *\n * - `onload`: Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * A view can be unnamed or named.\n * ```html\n * <!-- Unnamed -->\n * <div ui-view></div>\n *\n * <!-- Named -->\n * <div ui-view=\"viewName\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- Named (different style) -->\n * <ui-view name=\"viewName\"></ui-view>\n * ```\n *\n * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a\n * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the\n * [[Ng1StateDeclaration.views]] config property, by name, in this case an empty name:\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view\n * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one,\n * but you could if you wanted, like so:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ui-view=\"main\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"main\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"chart\"></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"data\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     },\n *     \"chart\": {\n *       template: \"<chart_thing/>\"\n *     },\n *     \"data\": {\n *       template: \"<data_thing/>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * #### Examples for `autoscroll`:\n * ```html\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll/>\n *\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>\n * ```\n *\n * Resolve data:\n *\n * The resolved data from the state's `resolve` block is placed on the scope as `$resolve` (this\n * can be customized using [[Ng1ViewDeclaration.resolveAs]]).  This can be then accessed from the template.\n *\n * Note that when `controllerAs` is being used, `$resolve` is set on the controller instance *after* the\n * controller is instantiated.  The `$onInit()` hook can be used to perform initialization code which\n * depends on `$resolve` data.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state('home', {\n *   template: '<my-component user=\"$resolve.user\"></my-component>',\n *   resolve: {\n *     user: function(UserService) { return UserService.fetchUser(); }\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n */\nexport var uiView;\nuiView = [\n

When a `ui-view` has a name, it will be filled in\n * by a matching named view.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```js\n * stateRegistry.register({\n *   name: 'foo',\n *   url: '/foo',\n *   views: { header: HeaderComponent, $default: FooComponent });\n * ```\n * ```html\n * <!-- When 'foo' state is active, filled by HeaderComponent -->\n * <div ui-view=\"header\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- When 'foo' state is active, filled by FooComponent -->\n * <ui-view></ui-view>\n * ```\n */\nvar UIView = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function UIView(router, parent, viewContainerRef) {\n        this.router = router;\n        this.viewContainerRef = viewContainerRef;\n        /** Data about the this UIView */\n        this._uiViewData = {};\n        this._parent = parent;\n    }\n    UIView_1 = UIView;\n    Object.defineProperty(UIView.prototype, \"_name\", {\n        set: function (val) {\n            this.name = val;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(UIView.prototype, \"state\", {\n        /**\n         * @returns the UI-Router `state` that is filling this uiView, or `undefined`.\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return parse('_uiViewData.config.viewDecl.$context.self')(this);\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    UIView.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n        var _this = this;\n        var router = this.router;\n        var parentFqn = this._parent.fqn;\n        var name = this.name || '$default';\n        this._uiViewData = {\n            $type: 'ng2',\n            id: id$1++,\n            name: name,\n            fqn: parentFqn ? parentFqn + '.' + name : name,\n            creationContext: this._parent.context,\n            configUpdated: this._viewConfigUpdated.bind(this),\n            config: undefined,\n        };\n        this._deregisterUiCanExitHook = router.transitionService.onBefore({}, function (trans) {\n            return _this._invokeUiCanExitHook(trans);\n        });\n        this._deregisterUiOnParamsChangedHook = router.transitionService.onSuccess({}, function (trans) {\n            return _this._invokeUiOnParamsChangedHook(trans);\n        });\n        this._deregisterUIView = router.viewService.registerUIView(this._uiViewData);\n    };\n    /**\n     * For each transition, checks the component loaded in the ui-view for:\n     *\n     * - has a uiCanExit() component hook\n     * - is being exited\n     *\n     * If both are true, adds the uiCanExit component function as a hook to that singular Transition.\n     */\n    UIView.prototype._invokeUiCanExitHook = function (trans) {\n        var instance = this._componentRef && this._componentRef.instance;\n        var uiCanExitFn = instance && instance.uiCanExit;\n        if (isFunction(uiCanExitFn)) {\n            var state = this.state;\n            if (trans.exiting().indexOf(state) !== -1) {\n                trans.onStart({}, function () {\n                    return uiCanExitFn.call(instance, trans);\n                });\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * For each transition, checks if any param values changed and notify component\n     */\n    UIView.prototype._invokeUiOnParamsChangedHook = function ($transition$) {\n        var instance = this._componentRef && this._componentRef.instance;\n        var uiOnParamsChanged = instance && instance.uiOnParamsChanged;\n        if (isFunction(uiOnParamsChanged)) {\n            var viewState = this.state;\n            var resolveContext = new ResolveContext(this._uiViewData.config.path);\n            var viewCreationTrans = resolveContext.getResolvable('$transition$').data;\n            // Exit early if the $transition$ is the same as the view was created within.\n            // Exit early if the $transition$ will exit the state the view is for.\n            if ($transition$ === viewCreationTrans || $transition$.exiting().indexOf(viewState) !== -1)\n                return;\n            var toParams_1 = $transition$.params('to');\n            var fromParams_1 = $transition$.params('from');\n            var getNodeSchema = function (node) { return node.paramSchema;

state' -->\n * <a uiSref=\"bar\">Bar</a>\n *\n * <!-- Assume this component's state is \"foo\".\n *      Relatively targets \"foo.child\" -->\n * <a uiSref=\".child\">Foo Child</a>\n *\n * <!--

changes.\n *\n * This directive is primarily used by the [[UISrefActive]] directives to monitor `UISref`(s).\n *\n * This directive shares two attribute selectors with `UISrefActive`:\n *\n * - `[uiSrefActive]`\n * - `[uiSrefActiveEq]`.\n *\n * Thus, whenever a `UISrefActive` directive is created, a `UISrefStatus` directive is also created.\n *\n * Most apps should simply use `UISrefActive`, but some advanced components may want to process the\n * [[SrefStatus]] events directly.\n *\n * ```js\n * <li (uiSrefStatus)=\"onSrefStatusChanged($event)\">\n *   <a uiSref=\"book\" [uiParams]=\"{ bookId: book.id }\">Book {{ book.name }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * The `uiSrefStatus` event is emitted whenever an enclosed `uiSref`'s status changes.\n * The event emitted is of type [[SrefStatus]], and has boolean values for `active`, `exact`, `entering`, and `exiting`; also has a [[StateOrName]] `identifier`value.\n *\n * The values from this event can be captured and stored on a component (then applied, e.g., using ngClass).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * A single `uiSrefStatus` can enclose multiple `uiSref`.\n * Each status boolean (`active`, `exact`, `entering`, `exiting`) will be true if *any of the enclosed `uiSref` status is true*.\n * In other words, all enclosed `uiSref` statuses  are merged to a single status using `||` (logical or).\n *\n * ```js\n * <li (uiSrefStatus)=\"onSrefStatus($event)\" uiSref=\"admin\">\n *   Home\n *   <ul>\n *     <li> <a uiSref=\"admin.users\">Users</a> </li>\n *     <li> <a uiSref=\"admin.groups\">Groups</a> </li>\n *   </ul>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * In the above example, `$event.active === true` when either `admin.users` or `admin.groups` is active.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * This API is subject to change.\n */\nvar

active.\n *\n * ### Purpose\n *\n * This directive should be paired with one (or more) [[UISref]] directives.\n * It will apply a CSS class to its element when the state the `uiSref` targets is activated.\n *\n * This can be used to create navigation UI where the active link is highlighted.\n *\n * ### Selectors\n *\n * - `[uiSrefActive]`: When this selector is used, the class is added when the target state or any\n * child of the target state is active\n * - `[uiSrefActiveEq]`: When this selector is used, the class is added when the target state is\n * exactly active (the class is not added if a child of the target state is active).\n *\n * ### Inputs\n *\n * - `uiSrefActive`/`uiSrefActiveEq`: one or more CSS classes to add to the element, when the `uiSref` is active\n *\n * #### Example:\n * The anchor tag has the `active` class added when the `foo` state is active.\n * ```html\n * <a uiSref=\"foo\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Foo</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Matching parameters\n *\n * If the `uiSref` includes parameters, the current state must be active, *and* the parameter values must match.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * The first anchor tag has the `active` class added when the `foo.bar` state is active and the `id` parameter\n * equals 25.\n * The second anchor tag has the `active` class added when the `foo.bar` state is active and the `id` parameter\n * equals 32.\n * ```html\n * <a uiSref=\"foo.bar\" [uiParams]=\"{ id: 25 }\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Bar #25</a>\n * <a uiSref=\"foo.bar\" [uiParams]=\"{ id: 32 }\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Bar #32</a>\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example:\n * A list of anchor tags are created for a list of `bar` objects.\n * An anchor tag will have the `active` class when `foo.bar` state is active and the `id` parameter matches\n * that object's `id`.\n * ```html\n * <li *ngFor=\"let bar of bars\">\n *   <a uiSref=\"foo.bar\" [uiParams]=\"{ id: bar.id }\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Bar #{{ bar.id }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Multiple uiSrefs\n *\n * A single `uiSrefActive` can be used for multiple `uiSref` links.\n * This can be used to create (for example) a drop down navigation menu, where the menui is highlighted\n * if *any* of its inner links are active.\n *\n * The `uiSrefActive` should be placed on an ancestor element of the `uiSref` list.\n * If anyof the `uiSref` links are activated, the class will be added to the ancestor element.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This is a dropdown nagivation menu for \"Admin\" states.\n * When any of `admin.users`, `admin.groups`, `admin.settings` are active, the `<li>` for the dropdown\n * has the `dropdown-child-active` class applied.\n * Additionally, the active anchor tag has the `active` class applied.\n * ```html\n * <ul class=\"dropdown-menu\">\n *   <li uiSrefActive=\"dropdown-child-active\" class=\"dropdown admin\">\n *     Admin\n *     <ul>\n *       <li><a uiSref=\"admin.users\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Users</a></li>\n *       <li><a uiSref=\"admin.groups\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Groups</a></li>\n *       <li><a uiSref=\"admin.settings\" uiSrefActive=\"active\">Settings</a></li>\n *     </ul>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n

Each element of the array should be an array, a 2-tuple,\n * with a Predicate and a mapping/output function\n * @returns {function(any): *}\n */\nexport function pattern(struct) {\n    return function (x) {\n        for (var i = 0; i < struct.length; i++) {\n            if (struct[i][0](x))\n                return struct[i][1](x);\n        }\n    };\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=hof.js.map"],"sourceRoot":""}
